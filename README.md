# Kindness Cache
There is a saying,

>"It costs nothing to be kind."

Although it may not put a dent in one's wallet, habitual kindness requires every bit as much attention as adding anything new to one's daily routine. Whether it is showing kindness to `strangers`, `friends`, `family`, or `oneself`, these actions will require our thoughts and attention before they become second nature.

Kindness Cache allows the `User` to habitually develop and document `Acts` of kindness via entering, dating, and categorizing them. Once an `Act` is added to a `User's` `Cache` it then is added to `Stats` which allow a `User` to view their collection of `Acts` from a more holistic and macroscopic lens. All `Acts` also become a part of the `User's` `Store` in which `List`, `Detail`, and `Random` views are featured.
